Welcome to StreamLab, a beta dapp that tries to help the masses express their opinions about videos without the interference of middle parties because of the state of the art blockchain technology. Any user can upload a video by providing the link to the hosted site and say what they like or hate about a video, the users can also express their like or distaste by upvoting or downvoting a video. Users can like or dislike as many times as they want as this is to ensure everyone has the ability to express their views. A token of 1cUSD is used everytime a user likes a video as to ensure that the person who uploaded the video gets something for his time and effort.
